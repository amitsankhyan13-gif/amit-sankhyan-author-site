    <p>
      Amit Sankhyan is someone who observes people closely and believes that the quietest moments often carry the deepest truths.
      With a background in training, communication, and understanding human behaviour, he values empathy, reflection, and honest connection.
      His perspective is shaped by listening more than speaking, noticing emotions others may overlook, and finding meaning in everyday
      experiences that leave a lasting impact.
